Often people have unneeded things which they do not use anymore and would like to trade it. But what if you do not know what you want instead?    
Here comes *DINDER* for help! Just add the item you don't need and SWIPE it to exchange with other users! And that is it!

Dinder - developed for exchanging items the fun way!

# <a name="how-to-run"></a>How to Run?

```bash
  $ git clone <project>
  $ cd path/to/<project>
  $ ./provision.sh --schema --with-fixtures 
```

* `--schema` - used to recreate project's database;
* `--with-fixtures` - generates demo data (will not work without `--schema`);
